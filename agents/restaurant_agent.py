            Start with a brief introduction to the food scene in the location (1-2 sentences only).
            
            Then categorize restaurants by cuisine or type, for example:

            Use bullet points, keep descriptions concise, and clearly separate each restaurant listing.
            Use categories that make sense for the location (seafood, traditional, innovative, etc.)
            
            If you don't have specific information about restaurants in that location, provide general information about 
            the culinary scene and typical food specialties of that region, using the same format.""")
